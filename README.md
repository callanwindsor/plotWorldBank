# plotWorldBank
### This package plots a selected World Bank time series over a selected time period as a bar chart.
* This was a homework exercise for Topics in Big Data I; part of the Master in Data Science at the Barcelona GSE
* The exercise was to create a simple package in R with one or two basic functions
* One of the functions needed download data from a free API 
  * In this case I used the World Bank's API
